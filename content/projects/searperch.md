## Overview

I mentored K-12 students in building SeaPerch underwater remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) during a summer robotics camp. SeaPerch is an educational program that introduces students to engineering, design, and marine robotics through hands-on construction and testing.

## Building from Scratch

Over the course of the camp, students worked in teams to complete their ROVs from scratch. The project involved soldering electronic components, waterproofing motors, assembling PVC frames, and integrating control systems. Each team customized their ROV design—choosing between Utility, Mini, and V-Wing configurations—based on specific mission requirements.

The hands-on nature of the project taught students practical skills in electronics, mechanical assembly, and troubleshooting. Students learned to use tools like soldering irons, drills, and wire strippers, while also developing soft skills like teamwork and problem-solving.

## Testing and Iteration

Beyond just building the ROVs, students tested their vehicles in a pool environment, adjusting buoyancy, trim, and thruster angles to optimize performance. They learned about the engineering design process firsthand—iterating on their designs based on real-world testing and performance data.

## Final Demonstration 

The camp culminated in a final demonstration where teams showcased their ROVs' capabilities through navigation challenges and underwater tasks. Watching students progress from initial assembly to confidently piloting their custom-built underwater robots was incredibly rewarding, and many discovered a genuine interest in robotics and engineering along the way.
